I am turning this into a button game. :)

Goals for MVP:

1. Integrate AUTH0 (/login)
2. One button (/home)
3. Deploy site

Right now:
0. Integrate Supabase for a remote database.

# MakersBnB Python Project Seed

This repo contains the seed codebase for the MakersBnB project in Python (using 
Flask and Pytest).

Someone in your team should "Use this template" to create a copy of the codebase on their GitHub account.
Everyone in the team should then clone that copy of the repo to their local machine.

> NOTE: If you encounter a `ModuleNotFound` error, deactivate and then reactivate your virtual env. If that doesn't help, please reach out to your coach.

## Setup

```shell
# Set up the virtual environment
; python -m venv makersbnb-venv

# Activate the virtual environment
; source makersbnb-venv/bin/activate 

# Install dependencies
(makersbnb-venv); pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the virtual browser we will use for testing
(makersbnb-venv); playwright install
# If you have problems with the above, contact your coach

# Create a test and development database
(makersbnb-venv); createdb makers_bnb
(makersbnb-venv); createdb makers_bnb_test

# Open lib/database_connection.py and change the database names
(makersbnb-venv); open lib/database_connection.py

# Run the tests (with extra logging)
(makersbnb-venv); pytest -sv
